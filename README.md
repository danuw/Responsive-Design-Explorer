##Intro
Responsive Design explorer (let's call it RDE) is intended at users (mainly UI devs I guess) who receive responsive designs in three folders, usually Mobile, Tablet and Desktop and would like to be able to browse these designs side by side to more easily identify differences and similarities to build an efficient responsive layout and components.

##Installation
[Click here](https://github.com/danuw/Responsive-Design-Explorer/raw/master/BD.DE.Desktop/publish/setup.exe "setup link") to download the exe and run the installation. It will pick up the latest version in this repo and install it for you.

In the start menu, look for 'RDE' and start the application [1]. You will be presented with a Windows application with two main areas below the menu: Navigation on the left and the viewer on the right. That viewer is defaulted to show all three views from the start, but can be adjusted by switching on and off the selections of Mobile, Desktop or Tablet.
[1]:as it stands when you start the application you will likely be presented with a error message - the demo folder that should normally ship with this application is not yet happening - will update soon promise..

## Get Started
###Settings

![Settings menu](/img/settings-menu.png)

To get started, you will need to reveal the settings panel from the menu, select the root folder in which your Mobile, Desktop and Tablet folders sit and click Save to apply the changes. To refresh, go to File/Refresh menu. All three folders need to exist so if the refresh fails just ensure all three folders exist. You can also edit their names in the settings.

###Explorer
Once the RDE is set up, the list of merged images from all three folders will appear with an indication (M, D and/or T) of where that came from.

The view menu allows you to select whether to see all three views, two or only one. You can even hide the Eplorer view.
